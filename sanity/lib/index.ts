 * Sanity CMS Integration
 * Main export file for all Sanity-related utilities
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do NOT export SanityLive or sanityFetch from this file
 * - They use defineLive which can only be used in Server Components
 * - Import them directly from "@/sanity/lib/live" in Server Components only
 * - This prevents client components from accidentally importing live.ts

// Import sanityFetch directly from "@/sanity/lib/live" in Server Components
